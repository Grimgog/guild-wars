Ok well I am releasing my old autoit guildwars bot


BEWARE: I got banned from it, so use at your own risk. It should be used as reference and maby part of other bots, you should not use it as-is.


There are a couple stuff you need I dont remember all of them. But 32bit color and the resolution needs to be 1009x763 with windows classic theme if i remember good. Well I might have some stuff forgotten if you have problems you can pm me i will look further into the requirments you need butI dont really feel like it right now (I dont even know if someone will use this).

Why must it be in windowed mode ? plz ?

Because thats how I coded it and all the pixel locations are relative to the window size (a difference of 1 pixel in window size will change everything)
